Application that create many workers to encode many videos in golang

## Credits
Made by following [Fullcycle bootcamp](https://plataforma.fullcycle.com.br) provided by Code Education.

## Notes
This project is not working, its good to use as a reference for interacting with GCP and how to use goroutines, but the workflow is broke.
I don't have time to fix it, so I just archived for code reference.
